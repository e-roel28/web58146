    <p>Meet Sammy, a Yorkshire Terrier that has a big personality.</p>
    <li>Sammy used to have a very shiny black coat over his brown fur, but as he grew, it got lighter. He also has a tuft of white fur on his chest.  </li>
    <li>We were told that with proper care, Yorkies can live long and healthy lives, with an average lifespan of 12 to 15 years.</li>
    <li>.  We were told that with proper care, Yorkies can live long and healthy lives, with an average lifespan of 12 to 15 years. Sammy is only 6!</li>
    <li>Yorkshire Terriers are originally from England, but he grew up in a Mexican household. Heâ€™s probably bi-lingual because we talk to him in Spanish and English, but who knows, maybe he speaks with an English accent, and we donâ€™t even know, haha.</li>
    <li>Sammy is a silly dude, because when we started training him, we never got rid of the habit of him listening with treats, and now when we try to tell him to sit or bark he wonâ€™t unless you have a treat of a piece of food in your hand ðŸ˜… But as soon as you show that you have a piece of food in your hand, all his IQ comes rushing in and heâ€™ll do whatever you want</li>
    <li>We also enjoy Halloween with Sammy by dressing him up, and as you can see on the Gallery page, in October, we dressed him as a cowboy, and the funniest part about the costume is that when he walks, it looks like the whole cowboy is walking with the little arms on the side! </li>
    <p>Thanks for reading about some fun facts about Sammy! We both hope you have a great year!</p>
